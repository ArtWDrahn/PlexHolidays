Automatically find holiday movies/episodes on a Plex server and add them to a playlist.

Required Python3 modules: plexapi, imdbpy, tqdm

Note that this can be a lengthy progress if you have a large library. On my machine/network, it took an average of 1.5 seconds per movie/episode, which with my current TV library of ~1500 episodes adds up to 37.50 minutes.
